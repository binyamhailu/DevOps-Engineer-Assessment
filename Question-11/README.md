# Question 11: 
Monitoring React Native Mobile Appâ€™s API Endpoints

## Problem Statement

Monitoring API endpoints for a React Native mobile app is critical to ensure reliability, performance, and availability. The goal is to proactively identify performance bottlenecks, errors, and downtime while minimizing the impact on the user experience.

## Solution

### 1. **Using Sentry for API Monitoring**

Sentry.io is an excellent tool for monitoring API endpoints and tracking errors in real-time. Here's how it helps:

- **Error Tracking**:
  - Automatically captures and logs exceptions, providing detailed insights such as stack traces, request payloads, and user context.
  - Helps correlate frontend issues from the React Native app with backend API failures using distributed tracing.

- **Performance Monitoring**:
  - Tracks API response times, throughput, and latency, identifying slow or underperforming endpoints.
  - Generates actionable insights into bottlenecks in the API and highlights trends over time.

- **Proactive Alerts**:
  - Sends real-time notifications when error rates spike, APIs slow down, or thresholds are breached.
  - Integrates seamlessly with incident management tools like Slack and PagerDuty.

By implementing Sentry for both the backend API and the React Native app, you can trace the full lifecycle of a request, from the app to the backend, ensuring end-to-end visibility.

### 2. **Using Prometheus for Custom Monitoring**

Prometheus is a powerful open-source tool for monitoring metrics and setting up alerts. Here's how it complements Sentry:

- **API Metric Collection**:
  - Tracks metrics like request count, response time, and error rates for API endpoints.
  - Enables custom metric definitions, such as monitoring specific query performance or resource utilization.

- **Visualization with Grafana**:
  - Combine Prometheus with Grafana to create intuitive dashboards that display API health, uptime, and performance metrics in real-time.

- **Alerting**:
  - Prometheus supports rule-based alerting, enabling notifications when certain conditions are met, such as a high error rate or slow response times.

## Why Use Sentry and Prometheus Together?

- **Sentry** provides detailed error and performance insights, while **Prometheus** offers high-level metrics and flexible alerting.
- Together, they create a comprehensive monitoring setup:
  - Sentry handles in-depth tracing and debugging.
  - Prometheus tracks overall API health and sets up proactive alerts for performance thresholds.

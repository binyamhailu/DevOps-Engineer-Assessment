# Question 09: Troubleshooting a Slow Postgres Query

## Problem Statement

In a production environment, slow queries in PostgreSQL can significantly impact application performance and user experience. A systematic and professional approach is required to identify and resolve the root cause, ensuring the database remains performant under varying workloads.

## Solution

The troubleshooting process involves identifying the bottleneck in the query execution using diagnostic tools and optimization techniques. 

---

### 1. **Reproduce the Issue**

- **Isolate the Query**:
  - Identify the problematic query from application logs, database logs, or monitoring tools like **pg_stat_statements**
  - Ensure the query behaves the same way in a test or staging environment.

- **Run the Query in Isolation**:
  - Execute the query directly in `psql` or a SQL client (e.g., DBeaver, pgAdmin) to measure its execution time.

---

### 2. **Analyze the Query Execution Plan**

- Use the `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` commands to get insights into the query's execution plan:
  ```sql
  EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT ...;

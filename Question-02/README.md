# Question 02: 
Designing a Self-Healing Distributed Service

## Problem Statement

Let's talk about a common headache in distributed systems - they break... a lot! Whether it's running out of memory, network going down, or services just crashing, these issues pop up more often than we'd like. The real challenge here is: How do we build something that can spot these problems and fix itself without someone having to restart servers everytime?

## Solution

A self-healing distributed service is designed by combining proactive monitoring, orchestration, and redundancy. Kubernetes plays a crucial role in enabling these features:

### Key Features of Self-Healing

1. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Use **liveness** and **readiness probes** in Kubernetes to periodically check application health and readiness.
   - Automatically restart containers that fail health checks.

2. **Orchestration and Auto-Recovery**:
   - Kubernetes ensures crashed pods are automatically recreated and rescheduled on healthy nodes.
   - Horizontal scaling adjusts resources dynamically based on traffic or workload.

3. **Circuit Breaker Patterns**:
   - Isolate failing services to prevent cascading failures using libraries like Resilience4j.
   - Retry requests only after a cooldown period.

4. **Traffic Shifting and Load Balancing**:
   - Use Kubernetes services and tools like Istio to reroute traffic from unhealthy instances to healthy ones.

5. **Redundancy**:
   - Replicate data and services across nodes or regions for failover and high availability.

### Real-World Example

Consider an e-commerce system deployed on Kubernetes with services for orders, inventory, and payments. If the payment service crashes:
- Kubernetes restarts the service automatically.
- Load balancers redirect traffic to backup instances.
- Readiness probes ensure the service is only accessible when fully operational.

## Conclusion

By leveraging tools like Kubernetes and best practices like health checks, redundancy, and traffic management, we can design distributed systems that self-heal, ensuring high availability and minimal downtime.
